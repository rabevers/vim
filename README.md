vim
===
A personal configuration setup I'm putting together to start coding with Vim.
Most of my coding is web development with php, so that will be the main focus of this setup.

Todo
===
- Search project tree for strings in files
- Automatic tag generation for auto complete
- Show a list with parse errors if they occur, now only the line is highlighted
