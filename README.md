vim
===
A personal configuration setup I'm putting together to start coding with Vim.
Most of my coding is web development with php, so that will be the main focus of this setup.

use git submodule update --init to initialize the vundle package

When checking out, checkout to the .vim directory
Open vim and execute :PluginInstall [see the vundle docs](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)


Todo
===
- Search project tree for strings in files
- Automatic tag generation for auto complete
- Show a list with parse errors if they occur, now only the line is highlighted
